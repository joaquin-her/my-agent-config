# README

This is an example agent configuration file for the Continue platform.

## Example Agent Configuration

The `new-agent.yaml` file defines a custom AI agent that can be used within the Continue environment. This agent specifies which AI models and MCP servers are available to it, along with its roles and capabilities.

## Models

The `models` section of the configuration file specifies the AI models that this agent can use. In this example, the `Local Copilot (La cabra)` model is configured using the Ollama provider with the `qwen2.5-coder:7b` model name.

## MCP Servers

The `mcpServers` section of the configuration file specifies the MCP servers that are available to this agent. In this example, the `anthropic/memory-mcp` server is configured for use by the agent.

This README provides a brief overview of the `new-agent.yaml` file and its components."
